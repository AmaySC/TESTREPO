## Best Practices for Building a Strong Community
## BE RESPECTFUL AND CONSIDERATE.

## Be welcoming and open-minded. 
Other Community members may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new members and those just getting started.

## Respect each other. 
Nothing sabotages healthy conversation like rudeness. Be civil and professional, and don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech. Don’t harass or grief anyone. Treat each other with dignity and consideration in all interactions.

You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But remember to criticize ideas, not people. Avoid name-calling, ad hominem attacks, responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content, and knee-jerk contradiction. Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

Communicate with empathy. Disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life. Being part of a community means interacting with people from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, many of which may not be your own. If you disagree with someone, try to understand and share their feelings before you address them. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions.

## Be respectful.
Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Elastic community to be respectful when communicating with other community members, as well as with people outside the Elastic community.



Keep it tidy. Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less time cleaning up. So:

1.) Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.

2.) Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.

3.) Don’t post no-content replies.

4.) Don't "bump" posts, unless you have new and relevant information to share.

5.) Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.


## What is not Allowed
## Threats of violence. 
You may not threaten violence towards others or use the site to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others. Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that way. If you think that someone else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism, stop. Don't post it. In extraordinary cases, we may report threats of violence to law enforcement if we think there may be a genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to public safety.

## Hate speech and discrimination. 
While it is not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, ability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or group of people on the basis of who they are. Just realize that talking about these or other sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even unsafe, if approached in an aggressive or insulting manner. We expect our Community members to be respectful when discussing sensitive topics.

## Bullying and harassment.
We do not tolerate bullying or harassment. This means any habitual badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of people. In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory.

## Impersonation. 
You may not impersonate another person by copying their avatar, posting content under their email address, intentionally using a deceptively similar username or otherwise posing as someone else. Impersonation is a form of harassment.

## Doxxing and invasion of privacy. 
Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject.

## Prurient/Sexually explicit content. 
Basically, don't post pornography. This does not mean that all nudity or sexual content is prohibited. We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or artistic purposes. If you have any questions or concerns about something you want to post, feel free to reach out and ask beforehand.

## Spam. 
Respect the GitHub Community Forum. Don’t post advertisements, link to spammy websites, or otherwise vandalize the Community. This Community is meant for GitHub users to discuss projects, learn, and share ideas with one another - not for advertising or other spam-like content. Content that we deem spammy will be removed.

## Active malware or exploits.
Being part of this Community includes not taking advantage of other members of the Community. We do not allow anyone to use our platform for exploit delivery (e.g. Using the Community as a means to deliver malicious executables) or as attack infrastructure (e.g. Organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers). Note, however, that we do not prohibit the posting of source code which could be used to develop malware or exploits, as the publication and distribution of such source code has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community.

## Recording at events. 
If someone says they do not want a picture or video taken of them, respect that choice. If they ask you to delete or remove a picture taken without permission, do so. Photographers (even paid event photographers) following or stalking attendees in order to get shots of a diverse group of community members is not acceptable. Some Elastic events include three types of lanyards: photos always okay, ask if a photo is okay, or no photos. Attendees are expected to look for lanyard types and obtain permission before taking a photo or video if the "ask me" lanyard is visible. If photography permission lanyards are not present, attendees are expected to always seek permission before taking a picture. Crowd shots where attendees faces are not visible is acceptable, regardless of lanyard type. Speakers can tell event organizers if they do not want their talk recorded.


  
# Keeping it short:

We all shall provide a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, 
physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venue,
including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled.
